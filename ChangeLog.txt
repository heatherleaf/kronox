ChangeLog for the KronoX time tracker
  http://code.google.com/p/kronox/
-------------------------------------

Version ???

* A new go on trying to fix issue 41: Comment disappears
  (which is related to issue 28)
* Added an optional "completed" date to the Tasks.
  This can be edited in the "Edit Task" panel, and it is
  shown as a column in the Statistics View.
  (this is a suggestion for issue 40)

Version 1.0b, 2010-02-11

* New icons for the status menu:
  - now there is one generic KronoX icon which is always there,
    and the symbol shown when recording is the Unicode Checkmark symbol 
  - this fixes issue 29, since there is no "play" (or "pause") icon anymore;
    but suggestions for alternative icons are welcome
* New program icon:
  - now there's a clock behind the god Kronos 
* Fixed issue 28: Comments in the currently recording work period sometimes disappear
  - I hope this is finally fixed, but you never know...
* Removed the "Add" and "Remove" buttons in the Edit Task panel:
  - they were unintuitive, and unnecessary
* Implemented a fix for a Snow Leopard bug, which had the effect that you couldn't close
  the Edit Workperiod Panel by pressing ESCAPE, if you were editing one of the dates.

Version 0.99.1, 2010-01-30

* Fixed issue 31: Error when trying to remove a 'normal working hours' setting
* Fixed issue 33: Main window jumps around screen when starting a new time period
* Fixed issue 35: Can't stop/start new work after deleting active task
* Fixed issue 37: Wrong date selections when moving from summary to detailed view
* Fixed issue 38: Repeatedly pressing Today when in Summary view keeps changing months

Version 0.99, 2009-10-09

* Added some basic help (available from the Help menu)
* (Issue 12) Added new attributes to Tasks: comment, and normal working time:
  - Both are optional, but if normal working time is used, 
    the statistics view will calculate the percentage of how much you have worked;
  - in that case you need to set the (total) normal working time in the preferences.
* Added a contextual menu where the user can show/hide different table columns in 
  the detailed and statistics views.
  This columns menu is also in the main menu (View -> Columns)
* (Issue 8) Better printing, but still not very good.
* (Issue 27) Added checking for idle time. The behaviour can be set in the preferences.
* (Issue 13) Overlapping work periods are marked in red (if activated in the preferences).
* (Issue 28, still not sure if it's fixed) 
  Fixed a bug with automatic saving of the database, which could retract pending changes.
* Changed the keyboard shortcuts for creating, editing and deleting Tasks.
* The detailed and statistics views now remember their own size.
  Also, the column widths and visibility are remembered between invocations.

Version 0.98, 2009-09-20

* New, simplified, search interface

Version 0.97b, 2009-06-01

* Now each task can have any color, not just named colors
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: All task colors previously defined will DISAPPEAR! You have to recreate them manually.
* Changed appearance of start and end date, in the main window
* (Fix, issue 19) Apple has solved the problem with NSOutlineView that caused issue #19, so lots of code have been removed

Version 0.96, 2009-01-23

* (Fix, issue 23) Fixed issue 23, which apparently wasn't fixed in v0.93 after all

Version 0.95, 2009-01-18

* Automatic update choices in the user preferences

Version 0.94, 2009-01-18

* (Fix, issue 7) Added automatic updating through the Sparkle Framework

Version 0.93, 2009-01-16

* (Fix, issues 19, 21, 23) An even better fix for issues 19, 21, 23
  - KronoX now also remembers expanded/collapsed tasks between startups
* (Fix, issue 24) Edit workperiod panel now works for 12h time format
* (Fix, issue 20) Added a new Total-% column to the statistics view
* Minor visal changes to the workperiod view and the statistics view

Version 0.92, 2009-01-14

* (Fix, issues 19, 21, 23) A better fix for issue 19 (also solving issues 21, 23)
* When adding a new task, it becomes a sub-task to the current selection

Version 0.91, 2008-12-19

* (Fix, issue 19) A workaround for issue 19: 
  - subtasks are collapsed whenever you start a new recording
  - this bug was introduced in Leopard 10.5.6, I don't know how it works
* (New bug, issue 21) The fix introduced a new bug, issue 21:
  - the task list is always fully expanded - cannot be collapsed at all

Version 0.9, 2008-12-07

* Initial version published on Google Code
