Verison 0.91, 2008-12-19

* A workaround for issue #19: 
  - subtasks are collapsed whenever you start a new recording
  - this bug was introduced in Leopard 10.5.6, I don't know how it works
* The fix introduced a new bug, issue #21:
  - the task list is always fully expanded - cannot be collapsed at all

Version 0.9, 2008-12-07

* Initial version published on Google Code
