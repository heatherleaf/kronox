## Adding time ##

**Can I add time periods from the past?**

Yes. The easiest way to do this is:
  1. Cmd-N to bring up new Work Period dialog. (Alternatively, you can click the "+" below the Work Period list, instead of Cmd-N or File->New Work Period.)
  1. Select the right Task from the popup menu, click on the right day in the Calendar picker (if its not a task from today). Add the start and end times, or enter the duration, and add a comment if wanted.  (You can move between most of the fields by pressing the Tab.)
  1. Press Escape or click the top left red button to save the Work Period and close the dialog. (In OSX 10.6 pressing Escape only seems to work from the Comments field.)

**Can I add multiple work periods from the past in one go?**

Yes, if those are events in iCal, you can import them into KronoX using the **File->Import from iCal ...** command.

**Will KronoX continue recording time against a task, even if I Quit the app?**

No.

**If I accidentally stop recording a time period, can I undo this?**

Yes you can. Either select "Undo Stop Recording" from the Edit menum, or type Cmd-Z.

**What does the View->Refresh command do?**

The total time is updated (in the status bar below the work periods/statistics). It is equivalent to clicking the small refresh icon at the bottom right corner.
